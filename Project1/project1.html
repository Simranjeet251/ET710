                Summer camp is a place for children/teens to go for the summer. Some camps are sleepaway, meaning that kids stay there the whole summer and sleep there. Others are day camps, meaning they go home at the end of the day.

            <h2>Hiking</h2>
            <p>Hiking is the activity of taking long, vigorous walks in nature for fun. Put on some sturdy shoes and bring along your water bottle â€” let's go hiking! We usually reserve the term hiking for walks in the countryside.</p>

            <h2>Bonfire</h2>
            <p>Campfires are commonly found at campsites, where they are used by campers for cooking and warmth. Bonfires are more likely to be found in open spaces such as beaches, parks, or fields, where they can be safely enjoyed by a larger group of people.</p>
