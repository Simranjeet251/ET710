        <h2>Campfire</h2>
        <a>In the context of a camp or gathering, a bonfire is a large, controlled outdoor fire, often used for warmth, celebration, or as a means of disposal, typically built in a large open area.Providing a source of heat and light, especially during cooler evenings.Serving as a focal point for social events and celebrations. Burning debris, brush, or other materials.Historically and culturally, bonfires have been used in religious and other ceremonies. </a>
        <p>Bonfires are significantly larger than campfires, requiring a large, open area to burn safely.Due to their size, bonfires need careful planning and execution to prevent uncontrolled fires and ensure safety. This includes clearing the area of flammable materials and ensuring a safe distance from buildings, trees, and other structures.</p>
